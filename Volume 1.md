# Definitions

1. `mass = density * volume`
2. `momentum = velocity * mass = velocity * density * volume`
3. **inertia** is either a `resistance` or an `impulse`. it is `resistance` when a stationary object refuses to change its state when acted upon by a force. it is `impulse` when an object in motion exerts force to change the state of the actor so as to maintain its current state of motion. but motion and stationary are both relative and thus both describe the same phenomenon.
4. `force = action(state) -> state (either rest or uniform motion)'` and force acts in a straight line
5. centripetal force is an attractive force towards a point, and can be contributed by `absolute`, `accelerative` and `motive` factors.
6. `absolute` contribution to the centripetal force is the intrinsic attractive force produced by the point, be it gravity, magnetism or some unknown attractive force
7. `accelerative` contribution to the centripetal force is the field around the point, where a higher velocity is generated within the same period of time if the object position is closer to the center, analogous to a faster nudge on an object at closer positions
8. `motive` contribution to the centripetal force is proportional to the momentum generated over a period of time towards the center. `accelerative` force generating `motive` force is analgous to a nudge producing momentum in an object.

# More precise definitions of common terms to ease misunderstandings
1. **absolute** time: flows continuously independent of any influence, also called duration. **relative** duration: determined in relation to motion, such as an 'hour', a 'day', a 'month', or 'year'.
2. **absolute** space: fixated and immovable and identical, independent of any influence. **relative** space: determined relative to the position of bodies. e.g. an airspace on an airfield looks stationary relative to the airfield, but is actually moving in absolute space, around the outer surface of the earth.
3. place is the space occupied by a body. it can be absolute or relative depending on the kind of space it occupies. place is a 3D space taken up by the entire object, not so much the position. a position can be thought of as a property of the place. when a whole body moves, that is equal to moving each part of the whole, from one place to another.
4. motion is the translation of place, and can be either absolute or relative based on the kind of place.

## Vaguer distinctions and philosophies
Time in that era is mainly measured through observing motion. Astronomers correct time by using astronomical equations. As any motion can be sped up or slowed, it is only a matter of choosing a sensible measure of time for observing phenomena.

# Determining relative motion and absolute motion
If two spheres are spinning in circular motion about their mid-point and they are joined by a cord, then there is tension in the cord that can be increased by applying a pair of opposite forces to the spheres and diminished by applying forces in the same direction to both. Even though the sphere may appear stationary if there are no observable reference or if the references are also moving, measuring tension is enough to determine the presence of circular motion.

# Laws of Motion

1. Every body preserves its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled to change by forces on them.

   Projectiles preserves their motion if not for air resistance and the downward force of gravity. A spinning top will spin perpetually if without the resistance of air. Planets and comets, in an environment of less resistance, preserve their motions longer.

2. Change in motion (momentum) is proportional to the motive force applied, in the direction of the straight line the force acts in.

  Twice the force will produce twice the motion (momentum). Forces acted at once or successively result in the same effect. If the body is in motion, forces are added on top of the former motion.

3. Every action always has an equal and opposite reaction. The mutual actions of two bodies on each other are always equal and in opposite dirctions.

### Corollary 1

For a parallelogram (left to right, top to bottom - ABCD), suppose force M is applied once to an object at `A`, making the object move with uniform motion to arrive at `B` over a certain duration. Suppose that another force N, when applied once also at `A`, will make the object move with uniform motion to `C` over the same duration. By the second law, since motion is changed only along the straight line which the force acts in, M and N do not interfere with each other. It can be concluded that the the object will have some motion in each direction, hence, at point `B`, a line is drawn to point `D`, such that `BD` is parallel to `AC`, to indicate the possible motion due to force N, and same for force M with the construction of line `CD` at `C`. It is known that the object, after that duration, will be somewhere along each of the lines. Therfore, the intersection at `D` is where the object will be and it will move in a straight line from `A` to `D` because motion is in a straight line if no forces act on the body.

> [!TIP]
> Why can displacement be used as a representation of force?
> 
> This is because by the second law, change in motion is proportional to the force applied in the force's direction. A greater force applied will result in a greater displacement in that direction, given the same mass (since it's the same object) and duration of motion (assumed when drawing the diagram).

> [!TIP]
> Why does only the ratio of lengths of displacements (force components) matter when determining direction, but not their absolute values?
> 
> Because of similar triangles, and how the ratios of sides of similar triangles maintain a constant ratio. If the angle of the overall displacement was different, then the triangles will no longer be similar and that will mean that the ratio of the sides are no longer the same. Simply increasing all sides by a constant factor will always create similar triangles
