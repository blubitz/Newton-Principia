# Definitions

1. `mass = density * volume`
2. `momentum = velocity * mass = velocity * density * volume`
3. **inertia** is either a `resistance` or an `impulse`. it is `resistance` when a stationary object refuses to change its state when acted upon by a force. it is `impulse` when an object in motion exerts force to change the state of the actor so as to maintain its current state of motion. but motion and stationary are both relative and thus both describe the same phenomenon.
4. `force = action(state) -> state'` and force acts in a straight line
5. centripetal force is an attractive force towards a point, and can be contributed by `absolute`, `accelerative` and `motive` factors.
6. `absolute` centripetal force is the intrinsic attractive force produced by the point, be it gravity, magnetism or some unknown attractive force
7. `accelerative` centripetal force is the field around the point, where a higher velocity is generated within the same period of time if the object position is closer to the center, analogous to a faster nudge on an object at closer positions
8. `motive` centripetal force is the momentum generated over a period of time towards the center. `accelerative` force generating `motive` force is analgous to a nudge producing momentum in an object.
