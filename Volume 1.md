# Laws
```
1. mass = density * volume
```
```
2. momentum = velocity * mass = velocity * density * volume
```

3. **inertia** is either a `resistance` or an `impulse`. it is `resistance` when a stationary object refuses to change its state when acted upon by a force. it is `impulse` when an object in motion exerts force to change the state of the actor so as to maintain its current state of motion. but motion and stationary are both relative and thus both describe the same phenomenon.
