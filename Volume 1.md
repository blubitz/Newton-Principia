# Definitions

1. `mass = density * volume`
2. `momentum = velocity * mass = velocity * density * volume`
3. **inertia** is either a `resistance` or an `impulse`. it is `resistance` when a stationary object refuses to change its state when acted upon by a force. it is `impulse` when an object in motion exerts force to change the state of the actor so as to maintain its current state of motion. but motion and stationary are both relative and thus both describe the same phenomenon.
4. `force = action(state) -> state'` and force acts in a straight line
5. centripetal force is an attractive force towards a point, and can be contributed by `absolute`, `accelerative` and `motive` factors.
6. `absolute` contribution to the centripetal force is the intrinsic attractive force produced by the point, be it gravity, magnetism or some unknown attractive force
7. `accelerative` contribution to the centripetal force is the field around the point, where a higher velocity is generated within the same period of time if the object position is closer to the center, analogous to a faster nudge on an object at closer positions
8. `motive` contribution to the centripetal force is the momentum generated over a period of time towards the center. `accelerative` force generating `motive` force is analgous to a nudge producing momentum in an object.

# More precise definitions of common terms to ease misunderstandings
1. **absolute** time: flows continuously independent of any influence, also called duration. **relative** duration: determined in relation to motion, such as an 'hour', a 'day', a 'month', or 'year'.
2. **absolute** space: fixated and immovable and identical, independent of any influence. **relative** space: determined relative to the position of bodies. e.g. an airspace on an airfield looks stationary relative to the airfield, but is actually moving in absolute space, around the outer surface of the earth.
3. place is the space occupied by a body. it can be absolute or relative depending on the kind of space it occupies. place is a 3D space taken up by the entire object, not so much the position. a position can be thought of as a property of the place. when a whole body moves, that is equal to moving each part of the whole, from one place to another.
4. motion is the translation of place, and can be either absolute or relative based on the kind of place.

## Vaguer distinctions and philosophies
Time in that era is mainly measured through observing motion. Astronomers correct time by using astronomical equations. As any motion can be sped up or slowed, it is only a matter of choosing a sensible measure of time for observing phenomena.
